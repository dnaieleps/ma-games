collection of all the little minigames / webapps i've made:


1.) Scientific Calculator:

Instead of a simple calculator that can only do one operation at a time, this calculator can evaluate expressions with multiple operators within the same expression all at once using stacks and priority queues. Inspired by Desmos / Symbolab. Includes functionality for log, ln, e, exponents, trig functions, radicals, factorials, etc. 
Primary languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Personal recreation of the retro game Minesweeper using object oriented programming. Intend to implement machine learning bot to be able to solve game in future.
